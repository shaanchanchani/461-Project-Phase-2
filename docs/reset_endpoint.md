# Reset Endpoint Documentation

## Overview
The reset endpoint returns the registry to its system default state by clearing all packages and restoring the default user configuration. This is a global system operation that affects all stored packages and related data.

## API Specification

### Endpoint
```
DELETE /reset
```

### Headers
- `X-Authorization` (required): Authentication token

### Response Status Codes
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200  | Registry is reset successfully |
| 401  | No permission to reset the registry |
| 403  | Authentication failed due to invalid/missing AuthenticationToken |

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  https://your-api-endpoint/reset \
  -H 'X-Authorization: bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...'
```

### Example Response
Success (200):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Registry reset to default state"
}
```

Error (401):
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "You do not have permission to reset the registry"
}
```

Error (403):
```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Authentication failed due to invalid or missing AuthenticationToken"
}
```

## Default State
After reset, the system will be in the following state:

1. Empty package registry (no packages stored)
2. Default admin user configured with:
   ```json
   {
     "User": {
       "name": "ece30861defaultadminuser",
       "isAdmin": true
     },
     "Secret": {
       "password": "correcthorsebatterystaple123(!__+@**(A;DROP TABLE packages"
     }
   }
   ```

## Implementation Guide

### Required Actions

1. **Authentication Validation**
   - Verify the provided authentication token
   - Check if the requester has permission to perform reset

2. **Storage Cleanup**
   - Remove all package files from storage
   - Clear all package-related metadata
   - Handle large datasets appropriately

3. **User Management**
   - Maintain or restore the default admin user configuration
   - Clear any additional user data if implementing authentication

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle authentication failures
   - Manage cleanup operation failures
   - Provide appropriate error responses

### Important Considerations

1. **Atomicity**
   - Ensure all-or-nothing operation
   - Implement proper rollback mechanisms
   - Handle partial failures appropriately

2. **Performance**
   - Consider impact of large data volumes
   - Implement efficient cleanup strategies
   - Handle timeouts appropriately

3. **Security**
   - Validate authentication thoroughly
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Maintain audit logs

4. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test with various data volumes
   - Verify complete cleanup
   - Validate default state restoration
   - Test error scenarios

## Monitoring and Logging

Consider implementing the following monitoring practices:
1. Log all reset operations with timestamps
2. Track the number of items deleted
3. Monitor operation duration
4. Set up alerts for failed resets
5. Maintain audit trails for security purposes

## Best Practices

1. Implement proper error handling and recovery
2. Consider implementing progress tracking for large resets
3. Maintain detailed logs for audit purposes
4. Implement proper access controls
5. Test thoroughly with various data volumes
6. Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. Implement timeout handling for large operations
8. Ensure proper validation of authentication tokens
